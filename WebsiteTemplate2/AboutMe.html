                <p> One starry night, as they sat on Spandana's porch, looking up at the sky, Krishay couldn't help but confess his feelings. "Spandana," he began, "I think I've fallen in love with you. You brighten up my life like that sunflower in your garden." Spandana, touched by Krishay's words, felt her heart race. She realized that she had fallen for him as well. With a trembling voice, she said, "Krishay, I love you too. You make every day special, just like that sunflower."</p>
